## Worker Lifecycle

### 1) Discover and add workers

```bash
rch workers discover
rch workers discover --probe
rch workers discover --add --yes
```

### 2) Complete setup

```bash
rch workers setup --all
```

This performs the standard bootstrap path (binary/toolchain setup, validation) for configured workers.

### 3) Validate runtime health

```bash
rch workers list --speedscore
rch workers probe --all                 # component matrix + probe_warnings (PATH-fallback resolutions, failed sub-probes)
rch workers capabilities --refresh
rch workers compare <id> <id>...        # side-by-side SpeedScore data
rch status --fleet                      # desired vs live: eligible / bypassed / disabled / unreachable / missing
rch check
```

Alternative to `discover`: `rch workers init [-y]` writes `workers.toml` from
detected defaults. There is no `rch workers add|remove`; edit the file
(`rch config edit --workers`) and re-run `rch config validate`.

---

## Add a Worker Manually

Edit `~/.config/rch/workers.toml`:

```toml
[[workers]]
id = "new-worker"
host = "203.0.113.20"
user = "ubuntu"
identity_file = "~/.ssh/new_worker_ed25519"
total_slots = 16
priority = 90
tags = ["rust", "bun"]
```

Then validate and setup:

```bash
rch config validate
rch workers probe new-worker
rch workers setup new-worker
```

---

## Drain / Disable / Enable

Use these for maintenance windows and incident isolation.

```bash
rch workers drain <worker> -y
rch workers disable <worker> --reason "maintenance" --drain -y
rch workers enable <worker>
```

State model (operator-visible):

- `HEALTHY`: accepting jobs
- `DRAINING`: finishing active jobs, no new jobs
- `DRAINED`: idle and not accepting jobs
- `DISABLED`: explicitly offline from scheduler (**admin-disabled**; never probed)

Daemon-side lifecycle on top of that:

- **Temporary bypass** — a worker that hit a transient failure is quarantined
  with a durable bypass record; `rch status --fleet` shows it as `bypassed`,
  selection reports it as unreachable, and requested-worker refusals cite
  `RCH-I009`. It **auto-rejoins** after `required_consecutive_passes` (2)
  fully-healthy probes across every hard dimension (ssh, worker binary,
  protocol, toolchain, disk ≥ 5 GB, load, telemetry) followed by a passing
  canary build; one failing dimension resets the streak. Backoff 30 s → 900 s.
- `rch workers enable <id>` deletes the persisted bypass record, so an operator
  re-enable survives a daemon restart; a restart never silently un-bypasses.
- Circuit breaker (`[circuit]`: 3 failures / 60 s window / 30 s cooldown /
  1 half-open probe) is separate and self-clears.

---

## Toolchain and Binary Management

```bash
rch workers sync-toolchain --all
rch workers deploy-binary --all
```

Use `--dry-run` before broad changes:

```bash
rch workers sync-toolchain --all --dry-run
rch workers deploy-binary --all --dry-run
```

---

## Fleet-Level Rollout Commands

```bash
rch fleet status [--watch]
rch fleet verify
rch fleet deploy --verify
rch fleet deploy --canary 25 --canary-wait 60 --verify
rch fleet deploy --worker <id> --verify
rch fleet rollback --verify
rch fleet history --limit 20
rch fleet drain [--all|<worker>] [--timeout 120] -y
rch fleet doctor --reliability [--scope topology,pressure] [--workers a,b]   # --fix needs --fleet-confirm
```

There is no `rch fleet enable`; re-enable with `rch workers enable <id>`.
`rch fleet status` probes with a fixed 10 s SSH budget and can mark a loaded but
healthy worker `Unreachable` (open bug `bd-rch-fleet-status-timeout-vs-unreachable-flhrk`);
cross-check with `rch workers probe <id>` (default SSH options: 10 s connect,
300 s command) before acting.

Release packaging changed in v1.0.58: cargo-dist is gone; binaries ship as
split profiles (`wrapper-release` for `rch`/`rabs-wrap`, `daemon-release` for
`rchd`/`rch-wkr`) with sha256 sidecars, and `install.sh` never downgrades
(`enforce_no_downgrade`). Cross-platform: a pre-deploy OS/arch guard refuses to
push a darwin `rch-wkr` onto a linux worker (`RCH-E705`; bug `6h54q` closed) —
it refuses, it does not cross-build.

---

## Cross-Platform Workers (`os =`)

A worker whose host OS differs from the rest of the fleet — a Windows box for
`*-pc-windows-msvc` builds, say — must declare it:

```toml
[[workers]]
id = "win1"
host = "<tailscale-ip-or-hostname>"
user = "<ssh-user>"
identity_file = "~/.ssh/<key>"
total_slots = 4
priority = 60
os = "windows"          # linux | darwin | windows
tags = ["rust"]
```

`os` is a **hard admission gate**, unlike `tags`, which are descriptive and gate
nothing. Declaring it makes the worker **exclusive**: it accepts only commands
that require that OS, so an ordinary `cargo check` dispatched from a Linux or
macOS orchestrator can never land there and hand back wrong-platform artifacts.
A worker with no `os` set keeps taking anything — which is why every existing
worker is unaffected.

The requirement is derived from the command's `--target` triple:

| Triple | Requires | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `*-pc-windows-msvc` | `os = "windows"` | links against the MSVC toolchain |
| `*-apple-*` (darwin/ios/tvos/watchos) | `os = "darwin"` | needs the macOS SDK |
| `*-pc-windows-gnu`, `wasm32-*`, everything else | nothing | cross-compiles fine from Linux |

Consequences worth knowing:

- A `--target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` build with **no** `os = "windows"` worker in
  the fleet finds nothing admissible and falls back to **local** — better than the
  old behaviour of shipping it to a Linux worker to fail.
- `rch status` diagnostics report the exclusion as reason code
  `os.declared_mismatch`, so you can tell it apart from a busy or unhealthy worker.

> **Deploy order matters.** `WorkerEntry` does not use
> `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, so an rchd built *before* this gate existed
> parses `os = "windows"`, silently discards it, and treats the machine as an
> ordinary worker that accepts every Linux job. **Roll rchd out to the whole
> fleet first, then add the worker** — the reverse order fails silently.

### Windows worker offload (setup + transport)

A Windows worker builds under **`C:/rch`** (drive letter + forward slashes — Git's
POSIX `sh` and `cargo.exe` both accept that form) and syncs over **tar-over-ssh**,
not rsync. Every bit of this is gated on the worker's declared `os = "windows"`,
so the Linux/macOS fleet paths stay byte-identical.

One-time setup on the Windows box (the `os` gate shipped in v1.0.53; the Windows tar-over-ssh transport in v1.0.56 — run 1.0.56+):

1. Install Git for Windows, the Rust toolchain(s) you build with, and the MSVC
   build tools (so `link.exe` exists for `*-pc-windows-msvc`).
2. Point sshd at Git bash so the daemon's raw POSIX probes parse (cmd.exe mangles
   quotes): set the `DefaultShell` registry value under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH`
   to `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`.
3. Append `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` to the **machine** PATH — this supplies a
   native `tar` for the transport.
4. Set machine env `RCH_WKR_CANONICAL_ROOT=C:/rch` and `RCH_WKR_ALIAS_ROOT=C:/rch`.
   Without them the worker reports `projects_root_ok:false` and the daemon's
   topology preflight excludes it (Windows has no `/data/projects` alias-symlink
   topology — that check is a no-op there by design).
5. Build `rch-wkr` **natively** on the box and put it on PATH (e.g.
   `~/.local/bin/rch-wkr.exe`). Cross-compiling it from macOS/Linux fails at MSVC
   build scripts. Rebuild it on each rch release.
6. Install every toolchain your projects pin (`rustup toolchain install <pinned>`).
   The daemon's toolchain preflight requires the *exact* toolchain the client
   sends, or the worker is excluded with `toolchain_preflight_command_failed`.

Then add the worker with `os = "windows"` (after the fleet-wide rchd rollout) and
run a `cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`; the native `.exe`
is retrieved back into the local `target/`.

**v1 limitations, worth stating up front:**

- Best for **standalone crates / self-contained workspaces**. Multi-root
  path-dependency closures across sibling repos are not remapped under `C:/rch`
  (nor is clean-overlay / git-archive mode), so those fall back to local.
- Worker telemetry is a permanent **fail-open TelemetryGap** — the `/proc`-based
  collectors don't run on Windows, so `rch-wkr telemetry` returns nothing.
  Selection still works (the gap is a soft penalty; disk-free comes from the
  capabilities probe), but expect a steady `/proc/stat` warning in daemon logs.
- No in-session watchdog / process-group cancellation for Windows builds. The SSH
  ConnectTimeout, the per-command timeout, and the daemon stuck-detector still
  bound runaways.

## Worker Selection Notes

Selection favors availability and execution quality signals (slot capacity, health, and policy strategy).

Operational guidance:

- Keep `total_slots` realistic for CPU and memory limits.
- Prefer explicit `priority` shaping for known fast/reliable workers.
- Drain before disruptive operations.
- Keep worker toolchains synchronized to avoid fallback churn.
- Set `os` only on genuinely cross-platform workers; it fences them off from
  everything else.

## SSH Verification Shortcuts

Single worker:

```bash
rch workers probe <worker>
```

All workers with machine-readable output:

```bash
rch --json workers probe --all
```

If probes fail:

1. Verify `identity_file` exists and permissions are restrictive (`rch config doctor` flags missing keys).
2. Verify worker host reachability and SSH service.
3. Re-run `rch workers setup <worker>` after connectivity is restored.

If **every** worker is rejected with `RCH-E205 missing clippy, rustfmt` while
`ssh <host> cargo --version` works: the worker's `rchd`/`rch-wkr` runs as root
under systemd with a PATH lacking `~/.cargo/bin`. Since commit `82b1033`
(2026-08-23, **not in the 1.0.58 release** — needs a main build on the worker)
the worker resolves `rustup`/`rustc` beyond the caller PATH
(`~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `/root/.cargo/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`) and
reports the fallback in `probe_warnings`; a 1.0.58 `rch-wkr` lacks this, so until a main build is deployed put rustup on the dispatch user's non-login PATH (`/root/.zshenv`, see `provision-new-machine`), or deploy a main build with
`rch fleet deploy --worker <id> --verify`. For root-dispatch VPS workers also
see `provision-new-machine` (root needs zsh + `/root/.zshenv` + rustup).
